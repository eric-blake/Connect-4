Connect-4 is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku.

Connect 4 is a two-player connection rack game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens. Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four "Wikipedia")

## How to play:

My verison of the game has been modified in to a one player game, where the player plays against the computer.

The player and the computer take turns dropping the tokens
